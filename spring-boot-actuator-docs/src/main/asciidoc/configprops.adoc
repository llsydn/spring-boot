=== /configprops
This endpoint is a report on the Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties` beans. Beans with
this annotation are bound to the `Environment` on startup, so they reflect the
externalised configuration of the application. Beans are listed by name. A bean that is
added using `@EnableConfigurationProperties` will have a conventional name:
`<prefix>-<fqn>`, where `<prefix>` is the environment key prefix specified in the
`@ConfigurationProperties` annotation and <fqn> the fully qualified name of the bean.
