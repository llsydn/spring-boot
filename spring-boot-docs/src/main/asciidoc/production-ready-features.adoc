= Spring Boot Actuator: Production-ready features

[partintro]
--
Spring Boot includes a number of additional features to help you monitor and manage your
application when it's pushed to production. You can choose to manage and monitor your
application using HTTP endpoints, with JMX or even by remote shell (SSH or Telnet).
Auditing, health and metrics gathering can be automatically applied to your application.

Actuator HTTP endpoints are only available with a Spring MVC-based application. In
particular, it will not work with Jersey <<howto.adoc#howto-use-actuator-with-jersey,
unless you enable Spring MVC as well.>>
--



[[production-ready-enabling]]
== Enabling production-ready features
The {github-code}/spring-boot-actuator[`spring-boot-actuator`] module provides all of
Spring Boot's production-ready features. The simplest way to enable the features is to add
a dependency to the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` '`Starter`'.

.Definition of Actuator
****
An actuator is a manufacturing term, referring to a mechanical device for moving or
controlling something. Actuators can generate a large amount of motion from a small
change.
****

To add the actuator to a Maven based project, add the following '`Starter`'
dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
----

For Gradle, use the declaration:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
	dependencies {
		compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
	}
----



[[production-ready-endpoints]]
== Endpoints
Actuator endpoints allow you to monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot
includes a number of built-in endpoints and you can also add your own. For example the
`health` endpoint provides basic application health information.

The way that endpoints are exposed will depend on the type of technology that you choose.
Most applications choose HTTP monitoring, where the ID of the endpoint is mapped
to a URL. For example, by default, the `health` endpoint will be mapped to `/health`.

The following technology agnostic endpoints are available:

[cols="2,5,1"]
|===
| ID | Description | Sensitive Default

|`actuator`
|Provides a hypermedia-based "`discovery page`" for the other endpoints. Requires Spring
HATEOAS to be on the classpath.
|true

|`auditevents`
|Exposes audit events information for the current application.
|true

|`autoconfig`
|Displays an auto-configuration report showing all auto-configuration candidates and the
 reason why they '`were`' or '`were not`' applied.
|true

|`beans`
|Displays a complete list of all the Spring beans in your application.
|true

|`configprops`
|Displays a collated list of all `@ConfigurationProperties`.
|true

|`dump`
|Performs a thread dump.
|true

|`env`
|Exposes properties from Spring's `ConfigurableEnvironment`.
|true

|`flyway`
|Shows any Flyway database migrations that have been applied.
|true

|`health`
|Shows application health information (when the application is secure, a simple '`status`'
when accessed over an unauthenticated connection or full message details when
authenticated).
|false

|`info`
|Displays arbitrary application info.
|false

|`loggers`
|Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application.
|true

|`liquibase`
|Shows any Liquibase database migrations that have been applied.
|true

|`metrics`
|Shows '`metrics`' information for the current application.
|true

|`mappings`
|Displays a collated list of all `@RequestMapping` paths.
|true

|`shutdown`
|Allows the application to be gracefully shutdown (not enabled by default).
|true

|`trace`
|Displays trace information (by default the last 100 HTTP requests).
|true
|===

If you are using Spring MVC, the following additional endpoints can also be used:

[cols="2,5,1"]
|===
| ID | Description | Sensitive Default

|`docs`
|Displays documentation, including example requests and responses, for the Actuator's
endpoints. Requires `spring-boot-actuator-docs` to be on the classpath.
|false

|`heapdump`
|Returns a GZip compressed `hprof` heap dump file.
|true

|`jolokia`
|Exposes JMX beans over HTTP (when Jolokia is on the classpath).
|true

|`logfile`
|Returns the contents of the logfile (if `logging.file` or `logging.path` properties have
been set). Supports the use of the HTTP `Range` header to retrieve part of the log file's
content.
|true
|===

NOTE: Depending on how an endpoint is exposed, the `sensitive` property may be used as
a security hint. For example, sensitive endpoints will require a username/password when
they are accessed over HTTP (or simply disabled if web security is not enabled).



[[production-ready-customizing-endpoints]]
=== Customizing endpoints
Endpoints can be customized using Spring properties. You can change if an endpoint is
`enabled`, if it is considered `sensitive` and even its `id`.

For example, here is an `application.properties` that changes the sensitivity and id
of the `beans` endpoint and also enables `shutdown`.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.beans.id=springbeans
	endpoints.beans.sensitive=false
	endpoints.shutdown.enabled=true
----

NOTE: The prefix ‟`endpoints` + `.` + `name`” is used to uniquely identify the endpoint
that is being configured.

By default, all endpoints except for `shutdown` are enabled. If you prefer to
specifically "`opt-in`" endpoint enablement you can use the `endpoints.enabled` property.
For example, the following will disable _all_ endpoints except for `info`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.enabled=false
	endpoints.info.enabled=true
----

Likewise, you can also choose to globally set the "`sensitive`" flag of all endpoints. By
default, the sensitive flag depends on the type of endpoint (see the table above).
For example, to mark _all_ endpoints as sensitive except `info`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.sensitive=true
	endpoints.info.sensitive=false
----



[[production-ready-endpoint-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia for actuator MVC endpoints
If `endpoints.hypermedia.enabled` is set to `true` and
http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas[Spring HATEOAS] is on the classpath (e.g.
through the `spring-boot-starter-hateoas` or if you are using
http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest[Spring Data REST]) then the HTTP endpoints
from the Actuator are enhanced with hypermedia links, and a "`discovery page`" is added
with links to all the endpoints. The "`discovery page`" is available on `/actuator` by
default. It is implemented as an endpoint, allowing properties to be used to configure
its path (`endpoints.actuator.path`) and whether or not it is enabled
(`endpoints.actuator.enabled`).

When a custom management context path is configured, the "`discovery page`" will
automatically move from `/actuator` to the root of the management context. For example,
if the management context path is `/management` then the discovery page will be available
from `/management`.

If the https://github.com/mikekelly/hal-browser[HAL Browser] is on the classpath
via its webjar (`org.webjars:hal-browser`), or via the `spring-data-rest-hal-browser` then
an HTML "`discovery page`", in the form of the HAL Browser, is also provided.



[[production-ready-endpoint-cors]]
=== CORS support
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing]
(CORS) is a http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[W3C specification] that allows you to specify in a
flexible way what kind of cross domain requests are authorized. Actuator's MVC endpoints
can be configured to support such scenarios.

CORS support is disabled by default and is only enabled once the
`endpoints.cors.allowed-origins` property has been set. The configuration below permits
`GET` and `POST` calls from the `example.com` domain:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.cors.allowed-origins=http://example.com
	endpoints.cors.allowed-methods=GET,POST
----

TIP: Check {sc-spring-boot-actuator}/autoconfigure/EndpointCorsProperties.{sc-ext}[EndpointCorsProperties]
for a complete list of options.



[[production-ready-customizing-endpoints-programmatically]]
=== Adding custom endpoints
If you add a `@Bean` of type `Endpoint` then it will automatically be exposed over JMX and
HTTP (if there is an server available). An HTTP endpoints can be customized further by
creating a bean of type `MvcEndpoint`. Your `MvcEndpoint` is not a `@Controller` but it
can use `@RequestMapping` (and `@Managed*`) to expose resources.

TIP: If you are doing this as a library feature consider adding a configuration class
annotated with `@ManagementContextConfiguration` to `/META-INF/spring.factories` under the
key `org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.ManagementContextConfiguration`. If
you do that then the endpoint will move to a child context with all the other MVC
endpoints if your users ask for a separate management port or address. A configuration
declared this way can be a `WebConfigurerAdapter` if it wants to add static resources (for
instance) to the management endpoints.



[[production-ready-health]]
=== Health information
Health information can be used to check the status of your running application. It is
often used by monitoring software to alert someone if a production system goes down.
The default information exposed by the `health` endpoint depends on how it is accessed.
For an unauthenticated connection in a secure application a simple '`status`' message is
returned, and for an authenticated connection additional details are also displayed (see
<<production-ready-health-access-restrictions>> for HTTP details).

Health information is collected from all
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/HealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`HealthIndicator`] beans defined
in your `ApplicationContext`. Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured
`HealthIndicators` and you can also write your own. By default, the final system state is
derived by the `HealthAggregator` which sorts the statuses from each `HealthIndicator`
based on an ordered list of statuses. The first status in the sorted list is used as the
overall health status. If no `HealthIndicator` returns a status that is known to the
`HealthAggregator`, an `UNKNOWN` status is used.



=== Security with HealthIndicators
Information returned by `HealthIndicators` is often somewhat sensitive in nature. For
example, you probably don't want to publish details of your database server to the
world. For this reason, by default, only the health status is exposed over an
unauthenticated HTTP connection. If you are happy for complete health information to always
be exposed you can set `endpoints.health.sensitive` to `false`.

Health responses are also cached to prevent "`denial of service`" attacks. Use the
`endpoints.health.time-to-live` property if you want to change the default cache period
of 1000 milliseconds.



==== Auto-configured HealthIndicators
The following `HealthIndicators` are auto-configured by Spring Boot when appropriate:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name |Description

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/CassandraHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`CassandraHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a Cassandra database is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/DiskSpaceHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`DiskSpaceHealthIndicator`]
|Checks for low disk space.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/DataSourceHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`DataSourceHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a connection to `DataSource` can be obtained.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/ElasticsearchHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`ElasticsearchHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that an Elasticsearch cluster is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/JmsHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`JmsHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a JMS broker is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/MailHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`MailHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a mail server is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/MongoHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`MongoHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a Mongo database is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/RabbitHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`RabbitHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a Rabbit server is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/RedisHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`RedisHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a Redis server is up.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/SolrHealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`SolrHealthIndicator`]
|Checks that a Solr server is up.
|===

TIP: It is possible to disable them all using the `management.health.defaults.enabled`
property.


==== Writing custom HealthIndicators
To provide custom health information you can register Spring beans that implement the
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/HealthIndicator.{sc-ext}[`HealthIndicator`] interface.
You need to provide an implementation of the `health()` method and return a `Health`
response. The `Health` response should include a status and can optionally include
additional details to be displayed.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Health;
	import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator;
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

	@Component
	public class MyHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {

		@Override
		public Health health() {
			int errorCode = check(); // perform some specific health check
			if (errorCode != 0) {
				return Health.down().withDetail("Error Code", errorCode).build();
			}
			return Health.up().build();
		}

	}
----

NOTE: The identifier for a given `HealthIndicator` is the name of the bean without the
`HealthIndicator` suffix if it exists. In the example above, the health information will
be available in an entry named `my`.

In addition to Spring Boot's predefined {sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/Status.{sc-ext}[`Status`]
types, it is also possible for `Health` to return a custom `Status` that represents a
new system state. In such cases a custom implementation of the
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/health/HealthAggregator.{sc-ext}[`HealthAggregator`]
interface also needs to be provided, or the default implementation has to be configured
using the `management.health.status.order` configuration property.

For example, assuming a new `Status` with code `FATAL` is being used in one of your
`HealthIndicator` implementations. To configure the severity order add the following
to your application properties:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.health.status.order=FATAL, DOWN, OUT_OF_SERVICE, UNKNOWN, UP
----

The HTTP status code in the response reflects the overall health status (e.g. `UP`
maps to 200, `OUT_OF_SERVICE` or `DOWN` to 503). You might also want to register custom
status mappings with the `HealthMvcEndpoint` if you access the health endpoint over HTTP.
For example, the following maps `FATAL` to 503 (service unavailable):

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.health.mapping.FATAL=503
----

The default status mappings for the built-in statuses are:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Status |Mapping

|DOWN
|SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)

|OUT_OF_SERVICE
|SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)

|UP
|No mapping by default, so http status is 200

|UNKNOWN
|No mapping by default, so http status is 200
|===



[[production-ready-application-info]]
=== Application information
Application information exposes various information collected from all
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/info/InfoContributor.{sc-ext}[`InfoContributor`] beans defined
in your `ApplicationContext`. Spring Boot includes a number of auto-configured
`InfoContributors` and you can also write your own.

[[production-ready-application-info-autoconfigure]]
==== Auto-configured InfoContributors

The following `InfoContributors` are auto-configured by Spring Boot when appropriate:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Name |Description

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/info/EnvironmentInfoContributor.{sc-ext}[`EnvironmentInfoContributor`]
|Expose any key from the `Environment` under the `info` key.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/info/GitInfoContributor.{sc-ext}[`GitInfoContributor`]
|Expose git information if a `git.properties` file is available.

|{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/info/BuildInfoContributor.{sc-ext}[`BuildInfoContributor`]
|Expose build information if a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available.
|===

TIP: It is possible to disable them all using the `management.info.defaults.enabled`
property.

[[production-ready-application-info-env]]
==== Custom application info information
You can customize the data exposed by the `info` endpoint by setting `+info.*+` Spring
properties. All `Environment` properties under the info key will be automatically
exposed. For example, you could add the following to your `application.properties`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	info.app.encoding=UTF-8
	info.app.java.source=1.8
	info.app.java.target=1.8
----

[TIP]
====
Rather than hardcoding those values you could also
<<howto.adoc#howto-automatic-expansion,expand info properties at build time>>.

Assuming you are using Maven, you could rewrite the example above as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	info.app.encoding=@project.build.sourceEncoding@
	info.app.java.source=@java.version@
	info.app.java.target=@java.version@
----
====



[[production-ready-application-info-git]]
==== Git commit information
Another useful feature of the `info` endpoint is its ability to publish information
about the state of your `git` source code repository when the project was built. If a
`GitProperties` bean is available, the `git.branch`, `git.commit.id` and
`git.commit.time` properties will be exposed.

TIP: A `GitProperties` bean is auto-configured if a `git.properties` file is available
at the root of the classpath. See
<<howto.adoc#howto-git-info,Generate git information>> for more details.

If you want to display the full git information (i.e. the full content of
`git.properties`), use the `management.info.git.mode` property:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.info.git.mode=full
----



[[production-ready-application-info-build]]
==== Build information
The `info` endpoint can also publish information about your build if a `BuildProperties`
bean is available. This happens if a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available
in the classpath.

TIP: The Maven and Gradle plugins can both generate that file, see
<<howto.adoc#howto-build-info,Generate build information>> for more details.


[[production-ready-application-info-custom]]
==== Writing custom InfoContributors
To provide custom application information you can register Spring beans that implement
the {sc-spring-boot-actuator}/info/InfoContributor.{sc-ext}[`InfoContributor`] interface.

The example below contributes an `example` entry with a single value:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import java.util.Collections;

	import org.springframework.boot.actuate.info.Info;
	import org.springframework.boot.actuate.info.InfoContributor;
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

	@Component
	public class ExampleInfoContributor implements InfoContributor {

		@Override
		public void contribute(Info.Builder builder) {
			builder.withDetail("example",
					Collections.singletonMap("key", "value"));
		}

	}
----

If you hit the `info` endpoint you should see a response that contains the following
additional entry:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"example": {
			"key" : "value"
		}
	}
----



[[production-ready-monitoring]]
== Monitoring and management over HTTP
If you are developing a Spring MVC application, Spring Boot Actuator will auto-configure
all enabled endpoints to be exposed over HTTP. The default convention is to use the
`id` of the endpoint as the URL path. For example, `health` is exposed as `/health`.



[[production-ready-sensitive-endpoints]]
=== Accessing sensitive endpoints
By default all sensitive HTTP endpoints are secured such that only users that have an
`ACTUATOR` role may access them. Security is enforced using the standard
`HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole` method.

TIP: Use the `management.security.roles` property if you want something different to
`ACTUATOR`.

If you are deploying applications behind a firewall, you may prefer that all your actuator
endpoints can be accessed without requiring authentication. You can do this by changing
the `management.security.enabled` property:

.application.properties
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.security.enabled=false
----

NOTE: By default, actuator endpoints are exposed on the same port that serves regular
HTTP traffic. Take care not to accidentally expose sensitive information if you change
the `management.security.enabled` property.

If you're deploying applications publicly, you may want to add '`Spring Security`' to
handle user authentication. When '`Spring Security`' is added, by default '`basic`'
authentication will be used with the username `user` and a generated password (which is
printed on the console when the application starts).

TIP: Generated passwords are logged as the application starts. Search for '`Using default
security password`'.

You can use Spring properties to change the username and password and to change the
security role(s) required to access the endpoints. For example, you might set the following
in your `application.properties`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	security.user.name=admin
	security.user.password=secret
	management.security.roles=SUPERUSER
----

If your application has custom security configuration and you want all your actuator endpoints
to be accessible without authentication, you need to explicitly configure that in your
security configuration. Along with that, you need to change the `management.security.enabled`
property to `false`.

If your custom security configuration secures your actuator endpoints, you also need to ensure that
the authenticated user has the roles specified under `management.security.roles`.

TIP: If you don't have a use case for exposing basic health information to unauthenticated users,
and you have secured the actuator endpoints with custom security, you can set `management.security.enabled`
to `false`. This will inform Spring Boot to skip the additional role check.





[[production-ready-customizing-management-server-context-path]]
=== Customizing the management endpoint paths
Sometimes it is useful to group all management endpoints under a single path. For example,
your application might already use `/info` for another purpose. You can use the
`management.context-path` property to set a prefix for your management endpoint:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.context-path=/manage
----

The `application.properties` example above will change the endpoint from `/{id}` to
`/manage/{id}` (e.g. `/manage/info`).

NOTE: Unless the management port has been configured to
<<production-ready-customizing-management-server-port,expose endpoints using a different
HTTP port>>, `management.context-path` is relative to `server.context-path`.

You can also change the "`id`" of an endpoint (using `endpoints.{name}.id`) which then
changes the default resource path for the MVC endpoint. Legal endpoint ids are composed
only of alphanumeric characters (because they can be exposed in a number of places,
including JMX object names, where special characters are forbidden). The MVC path can be
changed separately by configuring `endpoints.{name}.path`, and there is no validation on
those values (so you can use anything that is legal in a URL path). For example, to change
the location of the `/health` endpoint to `/ping/me` you can set
`endpoints.health.path=/ping/me`.

NOTE: Even if an endpoint path is configured separately, it is still relative to the
`management.context-path`.

TIP: If you provide a custom `MvcEndpoint` remember to include a settable `path` property,
and default it to `/{id}` if you want your code to behave like the standard MVC endpoints.
(Take a look at the `HealthMvcEndpoint` to see how you might do that.) If your custom
endpoint is an `Endpoint` (not an `MvcEndpoint`) then Spring Boot will take care of the
path for you.



[[production-ready-customizing-management-server-port]]
=== Customizing the management server port
Exposing management endpoints using the default HTTP port is a sensible choice for cloud
based deployments. If, however, your application runs inside your own data center you
may prefer to expose endpoints using a different HTTP port.

The `management.port` property can be used to change the HTTP port.

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.port=8081
----

Since your management port is often protected by a firewall, and not exposed to the public
you might not need security on the management endpoints, even if your main application is
secure. In that case you will have Spring Security on the classpath, and you can disable
management security like this:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.security.enabled=false
----

(If you don't have Spring Security on the classpath then there is no need to explicitly
disable the management security in this way, and it might even break the application.)



[[production-ready-management-specific-ssl]]
=== Configuring management-specific SSL
When configured to use a custom port, the management server can also be configured with
its own SSL using the various `management.ssl.*` properties. For example, this allows a
management server to be available via HTTP while the main application uses HTTPS:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	server.port=8443
	server.ssl.enabled=true
	server.ssl.key-store=classpath:store.jks
	server.ssl.key-password=secret
	management.port=8080
	management.ssl.enabled=false
----

Alternatively, both the main server and the management server can use SSL but with
different key stores:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	server.port=8443
	server.ssl.enabled=true
	server.ssl.key-store=classpath:main.jks
	server.ssl.key-password=secret
	management.port=8080
	management.ssl.enabled=true
	management.ssl.key-store=classpath:management.jks
	management.ssl.key-password=secret
----



[[production-ready-customizing-management-server-address]]
=== Customizing the management server address
You can customize the address that the management endpoints are available on by
setting the `management.address` property. This can be useful if you want to
listen only on an internal or ops-facing network, or to only listen for connections from
`localhost`.

NOTE: You can only listen on a different address if the port is different to the
main server port.

Here is an example `application.properties` that will not allow remote management
connections:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.port=8081
	management.address=127.0.0.1
----



[[production-ready-disabling-http-endpoints]]
=== Disabling HTTP endpoints
If you don't want to expose endpoints over HTTP you can set the management port to `-1`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.port=-1
----


[[production-ready-health-access-restrictions]]
=== HTTP health endpoint format and access restrictions
The information exposed by the health endpoint varies depending on whether or not it's
accessed anonymously, and whether or not the enclosing application is secure.
By default, when accessed anonymously in a secure application, any details about the
server's health are hidden and the endpoint will simply indicate whether or not the server
is up or down. Furthermore the response is cached for a configurable period to prevent the
endpoint being used in a denial of service attack. The `endpoints.health.time-to-live`
property is used to configure the caching period in milliseconds. It defaults to 1000,
i.e. one second.

Sample summarized HTTP response (default for anonymous request):

[source,indent=0]
----
	$ curl -i localhost:8080/health
	HTTP/1.1 200
	X-Application-Context: application
	Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v1+json;charset=UTF-8
	Content-Length: 15

	{"status":"UP"}
----

Sample summarized HTTP response for status "DOWN" (notice the 503 status code):

[source,indent=0]
----
	$ curl -i localhost:8080/health
	HTTP/1.1 503
	X-Application-Context: application
	Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v1+json;charset=UTF-8
	Content-Length: 17

	{"status":"DOWN"}
----

Sample detailed  HTTP response:

[source,indent=0]
----
	$ curl -i localhost:8080/health
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	X-Application-Context: application
	Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v1+json;charset=UTF-8
	Content-Length: 221

	{
	  "status" : "UP",
	  "diskSpace" : {
	    "status" : "UP",
	    "total" : 63251804160,
	    "free" : 31316164608,
	    "threshold" : 10485760
	  },
	  "db" : {
	    "status" : "UP",
	    "database" : "H2",
	    "hello" : 1
	  }
	}
----

The above-described restrictions can be enhanced, thereby allowing only authenticated
users full access to the health endpoint in a secure application. To do so, set
`endpoints.health.sensitive` to `true`. Here's a summary of behavior (with default
`sensitive` flag value "`false`" indicated in bold):

|====
| `management.security.enabled` | `endpoints.health.sensitive` | Unauthenticated | Authenticated (with right role)

|false
|*
|Full content
|Full content

|true
|**false**
|Status only

[[production-ready-jmx]]
== Monitoring and management over JMX
Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage
applications. By default Spring Boot will expose management endpoints as JMX MBeans
under the `org.springframework.boot` domain.



[[production-ready-custom-mbean-names]]
=== Customizing MBean names
The name of the MBean is usually generated from the `id` of the endpoint. For example
the `health` endpoint is exposed as `org.springframework.boot/Endpoint/healthEndpoint`.

If your application contains more than one Spring `ApplicationContext` you may find that
names clash. To solve this problem you can set the `endpoints.jmx.unique-names` property
to `true` so that MBean names are always unique.

You can also customize the JMX domain under which endpoints are exposed. Here is an
example `application.properties`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.jmx.domain=myapp
	endpoints.jmx.unique-names=true
----



[[production-ready-disable-jmx-endpoints]]
=== Disabling JMX endpoints
If you don't want to expose endpoints over JMX you can set the `endpoints.jmx.enabled`
property to `false`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.jmx.enabled=false
----



[[production-ready-jolokia]]
=== Using Jolokia for JMX over HTTP
Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative method of accessing JMX beans. To
use Jolokia, simply include a dependency to `org.jolokia:jolokia-core`. For example,
using Maven you would add the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>
		<artifactId>jolokia-core</artifactId>
 	</dependency>
----

Jolokia can then be accessed using `/jolokia` on your management HTTP server.



[[production-ready-customizing-jolokia]]
==== Customizing Jolokia
Jolokia has a number of settings that you would traditionally configure using servlet
parameters. With Spring Boot you can use your `application.properties`, simply prefix the
parameter with `jolokia.config.`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	jolokia.config.debug=true
----



[[production-ready-disabling-jolokia]]
==== Disabling Jolokia
If you are using Jolokia but you don't want Spring Boot to configure it, simply set the
`endpoints.jolokia.enabled` property to `false`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	endpoints.jolokia.enabled=false
----



[[production-ready-remote-shell]]
== Monitoring and management using a remote shell (deprecated)
Spring Boot supports an integrated Java shell called '`CRaSH`'. You can use CRaSH to
`ssh` or `telnet` into your running application. To enable remote shell support, add
the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-remote-shell</artifactId>
 	</dependency>
----

NOTE: The remote shell is deprecated and will be removed in Spring Boot 2.0.

TIP: If you want to also enable telnet access you will additionally need a dependency
on `org.crsh:crsh.shell.telnet`.

NOTE: CRaSH requires to run with a JDK as it compiles commands on the fly. If a basic
`help` command fails, you are probably running with a JRE.


[[production-ready-connecting-to-the-remote-shell]]
=== Connecting to the remote shell
By default the remote shell will listen for connections on port `2000`. The default user
is `user` and the default password will be randomly generated and displayed in the log
output. If your application is using Spring Security, the shell will use
<<boot-features-security, the same configuration>> by default. If not, a simple
authentication will be applied and you should see a message like this:

[indent=0]
----
	Using default password for shell access: ec03e16c-4cf4-49ee-b745-7c8255c1dd7e
----

Linux and OSX users can use `ssh` to connect to the remote shell, Windows users can
download and install http://www.putty.org/[PuTTY].

[indent=0,subs="attributes"]
----
	$ ssh -p 2000 user@localhost

	user@localhost's password:
	  .   ____          _            __ _ _
	 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
	( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
	 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
	  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
	 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
	 :: Spring Boot ::  (v{spring-boot-version}) on myhost
----

Type `help` for a list of commands. Spring Boot provides `metrics`, `beans`, `autoconfig`
and `endpoint` commands.



[[production-ready-remote-shell-credentials]]
==== Remote shell credentials
You can use the `management.shell.auth.simple.user.name` and
`management.shell.auth.simple.user.password` properties to configure custom connection
credentials. It is also possible to use a '`Spring Security`' `AuthenticationManager` to
handle login duties. See the
{dc-spring-boot-actuator}/autoconfigure/CrshAutoConfiguration.{dc-ext}[`CrshAutoConfiguration`]
and {dc-spring-boot-actuator}/autoconfigure/ShellProperties.{dc-ext}[`ShellProperties`]
Javadoc for full details.



[[production-ready-extending-the-remote-shell]]
=== Extending the remote shell
The remote shell can be extended in a number of interesting ways.



[[production-ready-remote-commands]]
==== Remote shell commands
You can write additional shell commands using Groovy (see the CRaSH documentation for details).
Due to limitations in CRaSH's Java compiler, commands written in Java are not supported.
By default Spring Boot will search for commands in the following locations:

* `+classpath*:/commands/**+`
* `+classpath*:/crash/commands/**+`

TIP: You can change the search path by settings a `shell.command-path-patterns` property.

NOTE: If you are using an executable archive, any classes that a shell command depends
upon must be packaged in a nested jar rather than directly in the executable jar or war.

Here is a simple '`hello`' command that could be loaded from
`src/main/resources/commands/hello.groovy`

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
	package commands

	import org.crsh.cli.Command
	import org.crsh.cli.Usage
	import org.crsh.command.InvocationContext

	class hello {

		@Usage("Say Hello")
		@Command
		def main(InvocationContext context) {
			return "Hello"
		}

	}
----

Spring Boot adds some additional attributes to `InvocationContext` that you can access
from your command:

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Attribute Name | Description

|`spring.boot.version`
|The version of Spring Boot

|`spring.version`
|The version of the core Spring Framework

|`spring.beanfactory`
|Access to the Spring `BeanFactory`

|`spring.environment`
|Access to the Spring `Environment`
|===



[[production-ready-remote-shell-plugins]]
==== Remote shell plugins
In addition to new commands, it is also possible to extend other CRaSH shell features.
All Spring Beans that extend `org.crsh.plugin.CRaSHPlugin` will be automatically
registered with the shell.

For more information please refer to the http://www.crashub.org/[CRaSH reference
documentation].



[[production-ready-loggers]]
== Loggers
Spring Boot Actuator includes the ability to view and configure the log levels of your
application at runtime.  You can view either the entire list or an individual logger's
configuration which is made up of both the explicitly configured logging level as well as
the effective logging level given to it by the logging framework.  These levels can be:

* `TRACE`
* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `FATAL`
* `OFF`
* `null`

with `null` indicating that there is no explicit configuration.



[[production-ready-logger-configuration]]
=== Configure a Logger
In order to configure a given logger, you `POST` a partial entity to the resource's URI:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"configuredLevel": "DEBUG"
	}
----



[[production-ready-metrics]]
== Metrics
Spring Boot Actuator includes a metrics service with '`gauge`' and '`counter`' support.
A '`gauge`' records a single value; and a '`counter`' records a delta (an increment or
decrement). Spring Boot Actuator also provides a
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/endpoint/PublicMetrics.{sc-ext}[`PublicMetrics`] interface that
you can implement to expose metrics that you cannot record via one of those two
mechanisms. Look at {sc-spring-boot-actuator}/endpoint/SystemPublicMetrics.{sc-ext}[`SystemPublicMetrics`]
for an example.

Metrics for all HTTP requests are automatically recorded, so if you hit the `metrics`
endpoint you should see a response similar to this:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	{
		"counter.status.200.root": 20,
		"counter.status.200.metrics": 3,
		"counter.status.200.star-star": 5,
		"counter.status.401.root": 4,
		"gauge.response.star-star": 6,
		"gauge.response.root": 2,
		"gauge.response.metrics": 3,
		"classes": 5808,
		"classes.loaded": 5808,
		"classes.unloaded": 0,
		"heap": 3728384,
		"heap.committed": 986624,
		"heap.init": 262144,
		"heap.used": 52765,
		"nonheap": 0,
		"nonheap.committed": 77568,
		"nonheap.init": 2496,
		"nonheap.used": 75826,
		"mem": 986624,
		"mem.free": 933858,
		"processors": 8,
		"threads": 15,
		"threads.daemon": 11,
		"threads.peak": 15,
		"threads.totalStarted": 42,
		"uptime": 494836,
		"instance.uptime": 489782,
		"datasource.primary.active": 5,
		"datasource.primary.usage": 0.25
	}
----

Here we can see basic `memory`, `heap`, `class loading`, `processor` and `thread pool`
information along with some HTTP metrics. In this instance the `root` ('`/`') and `/metrics`
URLs have returned `HTTP 200` responses `20` and `3` times respectively. It also appears
that the `root` URL returned `HTTP 401` (unauthorized) `4` times. The double asterisks (`star-star`)
comes from a request matched by Spring MVC as `+/**+` (normally a static resource).

The `gauge` shows the last response time for a request. So the last request to `root` took
`2ms` to respond and the last to `/metrics` took `3ms`.

NOTE: In this example we are actually accessing the endpoint over HTTP using the
`/metrics` URL, this explains why `metrics` appears in the response.



[[production-ready-system-metrics]]
=== System metrics
The following system metrics are exposed by Spring Boot:

* The total system memory in KB (`mem`)
* The amount of free memory in KB (`mem.free`)
* The number of processors (`processors`)
* The system uptime in milliseconds (`uptime`)
* The application context uptime in milliseconds (`instance.uptime`)
* The average system load (`systemload.average`)
* Heap information in KB (`heap`, `heap.committed`, `heap.init`, `heap.used`)
* Thread information (`threads`, `thread.peak`, `thread.daemon`)
* Class load information (`classes`, `classes.loaded`, `classes.unloaded`)
* Garbage collection information (`gc.xxx.count`, `gc.xxx.time`)



[[production-ready-datasource-metrics]]
=== DataSource metrics
The following metrics are exposed for each supported `DataSource` defined in your
application:

* The number of active connections (`datasource.xxx.active`)
* The current usage of the connection pool (`datasource.xxx.usage`).

All data source metrics share the `datasource.` prefix. The prefix is further qualified
for each data source:

* If the data source is the primary data source (that is either the only available data
  source or the one flagged `@Primary` amongst the existing ones), the prefix is
  `datasource.primary`.
* If the data source bean name ends with `DataSource`, the prefix is the name of the bean
  without `DataSource` (i.e. `datasource.batch` for `batchDataSource`).
* In all other cases, the name of the bean is used.

It is possible to override part or all of those defaults by registering a bean with a
customized version of `DataSourcePublicMetrics`. By default, Spring Boot provides metadata
for all supported data sources; you can add additional `DataSourcePoolMetadataProvider`
beans if your favorite data source isn't supported out of the box. See
`DataSourcePoolMetadataProvidersConfiguration` for examples.



[[production-ready-datasource-cache]]
=== Cache metrics
The following metrics are exposed for each supported cache defined in your application:

* The current size of the cache (`cache.xxx.size`)
* Hit ratio (`cache.xxx.hit.ratio`)
* Miss ratio (`cache.xxx.miss.ratio`)

NOTE: Cache providers do not expose the hit/miss ratio in a consistent way. While some
expose an **aggregated** value (i.e. the hit ratio since the last time the stats were
cleared), others expose a **temporal** value (i.e. the hit ratio of the last second).
Check your caching provider documentation for more details.

If two different cache managers happen to define the same cache, the name of the cache
is prefixed by the name of the `CacheManager` bean.

It is possible to override part or all of those defaults by registering a bean with a
customized version of `CachePublicMetrics`. By default, Spring Boot provides cache
statistics for EhCache, Hazelcast, Infinispan, JCache and Guava. You can add additional
`CacheStatisticsProvider` beans if your favorite caching library isn't supported out of
the box. See `CacheStatisticsAutoConfiguration` for examples.


[[production-ready-session-metrics]]
=== Tomcat session metrics
If you are using Tomcat as your embedded servlet container, session metrics will
automatically be exposed. The `httpsessions.active` and `httpsessions.max` keys provide
the number of active and maximum sessions.



[[production-ready-recording-metrics]]
=== Recording your own metrics
To record your own metrics inject a
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/metrics/CounterService.{sc-ext}[`CounterService`] and/or
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/metrics/GaugeService.{sc-ext}[`GaugeService`] into
your bean. The `CounterService` exposes `increment`, `decrement` and `reset` methods; the
`GaugeService` provides a `submit` method.

Here is a simple example that counts the number of times that a method is invoked:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.boot.actuate.metrics.CounterService;
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

	@Service
	public class MyService {

		private final CounterService counterService;

		@Autowired
		public MyService(CounterService counterService) {
			this.counterService = counterService;
		}

		public void exampleMethod() {
			this.counterService.increment("services.system.myservice.invoked");
		}

	}
----

TIP: You can use any string as a metric name but you should follow guidelines of your chosen
store/graphing technology. Some good guidelines for Graphite are available on
http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/06/26/practical-guide-to-graphite-monitoring/[Matt Aimonetti's Blog].



[[production-ready-public-metrics]]
=== Adding your own public metrics
To add additional metrics that are computed every time the metrics endpoint is invoked,
simply register additional `PublicMetrics` implementation bean(s). By default, all such
beans are gathered by the endpoint. You can easily change that by defining your own
`MetricsEndpoint`.



[[production-ready-metric-repositories]]
=== Special features with Java 8
The default implementation of `GaugeService` and `CounterService` provided by Spring Boot
depends on the version of Java that you are using. With Java 8 (or better) the
implementation switches to a high-performance version optimized for fast writes, backed by
atomic in-memory buffers, rather than by the immutable but relatively expensive
`Metric<?>` type (counters are approximately 5 times faster and gauges approximately twice
as fast as the repository-based implementations). The Dropwizard metrics services (see
below) are also very efficient even for Java 7 (they have backports of some of the Java 8
concurrency libraries), but they do not record timestamps for metric values. If
performance of metric gathering is a concern then it is always advisable to use one of the
high-performance options, and also to only read metrics infrequently, so that the writes
are buffered locally and only read when needed.

NOTE: The old `MetricRepository` and its `InMemoryMetricRepository` implementation are not
used by default if you are on Java 8 or if you are using Dropwizard metrics.



[[production-ready-metric-writers]]
=== Metric writers, exporters and aggregation
Spring Boot provides a couple of implementations of a marker interface called `Exporter`
which can be used to copy metric readings from the in-memory buffers to a place where they
can be analyzed and displayed. Indeed, if you provide a `@Bean` that implements the
`MetricWriter` interface (or `GaugeWriter` for simple use cases) and mark it
`@ExportMetricWriter`, then it will automatically be hooked up to an `Exporter` and fed
metric updates every 5 seconds (configured via `spring.metrics.export.delay-millis`).
In addition, any `MetricReader` that you define and mark as `@ExportMetricReader` will
have its values exported by the default exporter.

NOTE: This feature is enabling scheduling in your application (`@EnableScheduling`) which
can be a problem if you run an integration test as your own scheduled tasks will start.
You can disable this behaviour by setting `spring.metrics.export.enabled` to `false`.

The default exporter is a `MetricCopyExporter` which tries to optimize itself by not
copying values that haven't changed since it was last called (the optimization can be
switched off using a flag `spring.metrics.export.send-latest`). Note also that the
Dropwizard `MetricRegistry` has no support for timestamps, so the optimization is not
available if you are using Dropwizard metrics (all metrics will be copied on every tick).

The default values for the export trigger (`delay-millis`, `includes`, `excludes`
and `send-latest`) can be set as `spring.metrics.export.\*`. Individual
values for specific `MetricWriters` can be set as
`spring.metrics.export.triggers.<name>.*` where `<name>` is a bean name (or pattern for
matching bean names).

WARNING: The automatic export of metrics is disabled if you switch off the default
`MetricRepository` (e.g. by using Dropwizard metrics). You can get back the same
functionality be declaring a bean of your own of type `MetricReader` and  declaring it to
be `@ExportMetricReader`.



[[production-ready-metric-writers-export-to-redis]]
==== Example: Export to Redis
If you provide a `@Bean` of type `RedisMetricRepository` and mark it `@ExportMetricWriter`
the metrics are exported to a Redis cache for aggregation. The `RedisMetricRepository` has
two important parameters to configure it for this purpose: `prefix` and `key` (passed into
its constructor). It is best to use a prefix that is unique to the application instance
(e.g. using a random value and maybe the logical name of the application to make it
possible to correlate with other instances of the same application).  The "`key`" is used
to keep a global index of all metric names, so it should be unique "`globally`", whatever
that means for your system (e.g. two instances of the same system could share a Redis cache
if they have distinct keys).

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	@ExportMetricWriter
	MetricWriter metricWriter(MetricExportProperties export) {
		return new RedisMetricRepository(connectionFactory,
			export.getRedis().getPrefix(), export.getRedis().getKey());
	}
----

.application.properties
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.metrics.export.redis.prefix: metrics.mysystem.${spring.application.name:application}.${random.value:0000}
	spring.metrics.export.redis.key: keys.metrics.mysystem
----

The prefix is constructed with the application name and id at the end, so it can easily be used
to identify a group of processes with the same logical name later.

NOTE: It's important to set both the `key` and the `prefix`. The key is used for all
repository operations, and can be shared by multiple repositories. If multiple
repositories share a key (like in the case where you need to aggregate across them), then
you normally have a read-only "`master`" repository that has a short, but identifiable,
prefix (like "`metrics.mysystem`"), and many write-only repositories with prefixes that
start with the master prefix (like `metrics.mysystem.*` in the example above). It is
efficient to read all the keys from a "`master`" repository like that, but inefficient to
read a subset with a longer prefix (e.g. using one of the writing repositories).

TIP: The example above uses `MetricExportProperties` to inject and extract the key and
prefix. This is provided to you as a convenience by Spring Boot, configured with sensible
defaults. There is nothing to stop you using your own values as long as they follow the
recommendations.



[[production-ready-metric-writers-export-to-open-tsdb]]
==== Example: Export to Open TSDB
If you provide a `@Bean` of type `OpenTsdbGaugeWriter` and mark it
`@ExportMetricWriter` metrics are exported to http://opentsdb.net/[Open TSDB] for
aggregation. The `OpenTsdbGaugeWriter` has a `url` property that you need to set
to the Open TSDB "`/put`" endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:4242/api/put`). It also has a
`namingStrategy` that you can customize or configure to make the metrics match the data
structure you need on the server. By default it just passes through the metric name as an
Open TSDB metric name, and adds the tags "`domain`" (with value
"`org.springframework.metrics`") and "`process`" (with the value equal to the object hash
of the naming strategy). Thus, after running the application and generating some metrics
you can inspect the metrics in the TSD UI (http://localhost:4242 by default).

Example:

[source,indent=0]
----
	curl localhost:4242/api/query?start=1h-ago&m=max:counter.status.200.root
	[
		{
			"metric": "counter.status.200.root",
			"tags": {
				"domain": "org.springframework.metrics",
				"process": "b968a76"
			},
			"aggregateTags": [],
			"dps": {
				"1430492872": 2,
				"1430492875": 6
			}
		}
	]
----



[[production-ready-metric-writers-export-to-statsd]]
==== Example: Export to Statsd
To export metrics to Statsd, make sure first that you have added
`com.timgroup:java-statsd-client` as a dependency of your project (Spring Boot
provides a dependency management for it). Then add a `spring.metrics.export.statsd.host`
value to your `application.properties` file. Connections will be opened to port `8125`
unless a `spring.metrics.export.statsd.port` override is provided. You can use
`spring.metrics.export.statsd.prefix` if you want a custom prefix.

Alternatively, you can provide a `@Bean` of type `StatsdMetricWriter` and mark it
`@ExportMetricWriter`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Value("${spring.application.name:application}.${random.value:0000}")
	private String prefix = "metrics";

	@Bean
	@ExportMetricWriter
	MetricWriter metricWriter() {
		return new StatsdMetricWriter(prefix, "localhost", 8125);
	}
----



[[production-ready-metric-writers-export-to-jmx]]
==== Example: Export to JMX
If you provide a `@Bean` of type `JmxMetricWriter` marked `@ExportMetricWriter` the metrics are exported as MBeans to
the local server (the `MBeanExporter` is provided by Spring Boot JMX auto-configuration as
long as it is switched on). Metrics can then be inspected, graphed, alerted etc. using any
tool that understands JMX (e.g. JConsole or JVisualVM).

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Bean
	@ExportMetricWriter
	MetricWriter metricWriter(MBeanExporter exporter) {
		return new JmxMetricWriter(exporter);
	}
----

Each metric is exported as an individual MBean. The format for the `ObjectNames` is given
by an `ObjectNamingStrategy` which can be injected into the `JmxMetricWriter` (the default
breaks up the metric name and tags the first two period-separated sections in a way that
should make the metrics group nicely in JVisualVM or JConsole).



[[production-ready-metric-aggregation]]
=== Aggregating metrics from multiple sources
There is an `AggregateMetricReader` that you can use to consolidate metrics from different
physical sources. Sources for the same logical metric just need to publish them with a
period-separated prefix, and the reader will aggregate (by truncating the metric names,
and dropping the prefix). Counters are summed and everything else (i.e. gauges) take their
most recent value.

This is very useful if multiple application instances are feeding to a central (e.g.
Redis) repository and you want to display the results. Particularly recommended in
conjunction with a `MetricReaderPublicMetrics` for hooking up to the results to the
"`/metrics`" endpoint.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Autowired
	private MetricExportProperties export;

	@Bean
	public PublicMetrics metricsAggregate() {
		return new MetricReaderPublicMetrics(aggregatesMetricReader());
	}

	private MetricReader globalMetricsForAggregation() {
		return new RedisMetricRepository(this.connectionFactory,
			this.export.getRedis().getAggregatePrefix(), this.export.getRedis().getKey());
	}

	private MetricReader aggregatesMetricReader() {
		AggregateMetricReader repository = new AggregateMetricReader(
			globalMetricsForAggregation());
		return repository;
	}
----

NOTE: The example above uses `MetricExportProperties` to inject and extract the key and
prefix. This is provided to you as a convenience by Spring Boot, and the defaults will be
sensible. They are set up in `MetricExportAutoConfiguration`.

NOTE: The `MetricReaders` above are not `@Beans` and are not marked as
`@ExportMetricReader` because they are just collecting and analyzing data from other
repositories, and don't want to export their values.



[[production-ready-dropwizard-metrics]]
=== Dropwizard Metrics
A default `MetricRegistry` Spring bean will be created when you declare a dependency to
the `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core` library; you can also register you own `@Bean`
instance if you need customizations. Users of the
https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/[Dropwizard '`Metrics`' library] will find that
Spring Boot metrics are automatically published to `com.codahale.metrics.MetricRegistry`.
Metrics from the `MetricRegistry` are also automatically exposed via the `/metrics`
endpoint

When Dropwizard metrics are in use, the default `CounterService` and `GaugeService` are
replaced with a `DropwizardMetricServices`, which is a wrapper around the `MetricRegistry`
(so you can `@Autowired` one of those services and use it as normal). You can also create
"`special`" Dropwizard metrics by prefixing your metric names with the appropriate type
(i.e. `+timer.*+`, `+histogram.*+` for gauges, and `+meter.*+` for counters).



[[production-ready-metrics-message-channel-integration]]
=== Message channel integration
If a `MessageChannel` bean called `metricsChannel` exists, then a `MetricWriter` will be
created that writes metrics to that channel. Each message sent to the channel will contain
a {dc-spring-boot-actuator}/metrics/writer/Delta.{dc-ext}[`Delta`] or
{dc-spring-boot-actuator}/metrics/Metric.{dc-ext}[`Metric`] payload and have a `metricName`
header. The writer is automatically hooked up to an exporter (as for all writers), so all
metric values will appear on the channel, and additional analysis or actions can be taken
by subscribers (it's up to you to provide the channel and any subscribers you need).



[[production-ready-auditing]]
== Auditing
Spring Boot Actuator has a flexible audit framework that will publish events once Spring
Security is in play ('`authentication success`', '`failure`' and '`access denied`'
exceptions by default). This can be very useful for reporting, and also to implement a
lock-out policy based on authentication failures. To customize published security events
you can provide your own implementations of `AbstractAuthenticationAuditListener` and
`AbstractAuthorizationAuditListener`.

You can also choose to use the audit services for your own business events. To do that
you can either inject the existing `AuditEventRepository` into your own components and
use that directly, or you can simply publish `AuditApplicationEvent` via the Spring
`ApplicationEventPublisher` (using `ApplicationEventPublisherAware`).



[[production-ready-tracing]]
== Tracing
Tracing is automatically enabled for all HTTP requests. You can view the `trace` endpoint
and obtain basic information about the last 100 requests:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
	[{
		"timestamp": 1394343677415,
		"info": {
			"method": "GET",
			"path": "/trace",
			"headers": {
				"request": {
					"Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8",
					"Connection": "keep-alive",
					"Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
					"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/Firefox",

The following are included in the trace by default:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Name |Description

|Request Headers
|Headers from the request.

|Response Headers
|Headers from the response.

|Cookies
|`Cookie` from request headers and `Set-Cookie` from response headers.

|Errors
|The error attributes (if any).

|Time Taken
|The time taken to service the request in milliseconds.
|===



[[production-ready-custom-tracing]]
=== Custom tracing
If you need to trace additional events you can inject a
{sc-spring-boot-actuator}/trace/TraceRepository.{sc-ext}[`TraceRepository`] into your
Spring beans. The `add` method accepts a single `Map` structure that will be converted to
JSON and logged.

By default an `InMemoryTraceRepository` will be used that stores the last 100 events. You
can define your own instance of the `InMemoryTraceRepository` bean if you need to expand
the capacity. You can also create your own alternative `TraceRepository` implementation
if needed.



[[production-ready-process-monitoring]]
== Process monitoring
In Spring Boot Actuator you can find a couple of classes to create files that are useful
for process monitoring:

* `ApplicationPidFileWriter` creates a file containing the application PID (by default in
  the application directory with the file name `application.pid`).
* `EmbeddedServerPortFileWriter` creates a file (or files) containing the ports of the
  embedded server (by default in the application directory with the file name
  `application.port`).

These writers are not activated by default, but you can enable them in one of the ways
described below.



[[production-ready-process-monitoring-configuration]]
=== Extend configuration
In `META-INF/spring.factories` file you can activate the listener(s) that
writes a PID file. Example:

[indent=0]
----
	org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=\
	org.springframework.boot.system.ApplicationPidFileWriter,\
	org.springframework.boot.actuate.system.EmbeddedServerPortFileWriter
----



[[production-ready-process-monitoring-programmatically]]
=== Programmatically
You can also activate a listener by invoking the `SpringApplication.addListeners(...)`
method and passing the appropriate `Writer` object. This method also allows you to
customize the file name and path via the `Writer` constructor.



[[production-ready-cloudfoundry]]
== Cloud Foundry support
Spring Boot's actuator module includes additional support that is activated when you
deploy to a compatible Cloud Foundry instance. The `/cloudfoundryapplication` path
provides an alternative secured route to all `NamedMvcEndpoint` beans.

The extended support allows Cloud Foundry management UIs (such as the web
application that you can use to view deployed applications) to be augmented with Spring
Boot actuator information. For example, an application status page may include full health
information instead of the typical "`running`" or "`stopped`" status.

NOTE: The `/cloudfoundryapplication` path is not directly accessible to regular users.
In order to use the endpoint a valid UAA token must be passed with the request.



[[production-ready-cloudfoundry-disable]]
=== Disabling extended Cloud Foundry actuator support
If you want to fully disable the `/cloudfoundryapplication` endpoints you can add the
following to your `application.properties` file:


.application.properties
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.cloudfoundry.enabled=false
----



[[production-ready-cloudfoundry-ssl]]
=== Cloud Foundry self signed certificates
By default, the security verification for `/cloudfoundryapplication` endpoints makes SSL
calls to various Cloud Foundry services. If your Cloud Foundry UAA or Cloud Controller
services use self-signed certificates you will need to set the following property:

.application.properties
[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	management.cloudfoundry.skip-ssl-validation=true
----



[[production-ready-cloudfoundry-custom-security]]
=== Custom security configuration
If you define custom security configuration, and you want extended Cloud Foundry actuator
support, you'll should ensure that `/cloudfoundryapplication/**` paths are open. Without
a direct open route, your Cloud Foundry application manager will not be able to obtain
endpoint data.

For Spring Security, you'll typically include something like
`mvcMatchers("/cloudfoundryapplication/**").permitAll()` in your configuration:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{code-examples}/cloudfoundry/CloudFoundryIgnorePathsExample.java[tag=security]
----

== What to read next
If you want to explore some of the concepts discussed in this chapter, you can take a
look at the actuator {github-code}/spring-boot-samples[sample applications]. You also
might want to read about graphing tools such as http://graphite.wikidot.com/[Graphite].

Otherwise, you can continue on, to read about <<deployment.adoc#deployment,
'`deployment options`'>> or jump ahead
