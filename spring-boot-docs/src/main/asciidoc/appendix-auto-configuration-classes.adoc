== Auto-configuration classes
Here is a list of all auto-configuration classes provided by Spring Boot with links to
documentation and source code. Remember to also look at the autoconfig report in your
application for more details of which features are switched on.
(start the app with `--debug` or `-Ddebug`, or in an Actuator application use the
`autoconfig` endpoint).
